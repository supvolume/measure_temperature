Measure the temperature with the sensor connected to Raspberry Pi

I used Raspberry Pi 3 connected with a digital thermometer (model DS18B20) to measure temperature in my room every 10 minutes.


The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/supvolume/measure_temperature/blob/main/temperature_visualisation.ipynb).

The raw data for visualisation is in [temp_record](https://github.com/supvolume/measure_temperature/tree/main/temp_record).
